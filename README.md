#### Starting the game
To start the game, simply choose the game mode you want to play from the main menu. The next step is to configure game settings, such as the number of lives and the time per round, depending on the selected mode.

#### Selecting players
Next, select the players who will be participating in the game. Players play on their own or in teams, depending on the selected game mode. Each player chooses an emoji that will affect their theme throughout the game.

#### Game modes

Each mode is presented on similar UI but offers different experience. For now, the available game modes are:

1. **Questions Only**
<p>This game mode is the reason I created this project. Inspired by popular 90s TV show called "Whose line is it anyway?". Players face each other trying to keep the conversation on given topic using only questions. If player fails, they lose a heart and other player takes their place.</p>

  </div>

2. **Truth or Dare**
  <p>This is the classic party game. Players take turns in selecting Truth to answer a question or Dare to complete a dare that appears on the card. If they refuse, they lose a heart.</p>

3. **Taboo**:
<p>In this game mode there are teams of 2 players: speaker and guesser. Speaker has to describe the target words without using taboo words in given time. If their teammate guesses it, the team gets a point.</p>
